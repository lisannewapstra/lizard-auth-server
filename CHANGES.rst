0.1 (2013-08-30)

- Initial project structure created with nensskel 1.30.dev0.

- First release of lizard-auth-server based on a heavily modified
  django-simple-sso.

- Roles, Organisations and related data are now part of
  lizard_auth_server.

  version to construct the same information at the Portal side.

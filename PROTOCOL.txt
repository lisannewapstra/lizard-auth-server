There are three parties in the protocol, the 'client' is the user's
web browser, the 'server' is the Django website (uses
lizard_auth_client), and the 'sso server' is the SSO server
(lizard_auth_server).

1. User wants to login, either by clicking on a Login button or by visiting some
   page that is @login_required that redirects the client. Client visits /accounts/login/
   The URL to return to is stored on the _session_ as 'sso_after_login_next'.

2. /accounts/login/ maps to lizard_auth_client.views.LoginView. This
  gets a request token from the server by calling /sso/api/request_token
  on it using requests, also applying some itsdangerous magic.

3. The SSO server creates a Token, which is tied to a portal and
  consists of two random 64 keys: a request token and an auth token. The
  request token is returned.

4. LoginView now redirects to /sso/authorize/ on the SSO server, passing along
  and encrypted version of the request token. In short, /sso/authorize is told
  someone is coming before they are sent there.

5. User arrives at sso-server's AuthorizeView. User isn't logged in yet, so not
   authorized to be here, and gets redirected to the SSO server's login view (which
   is simply Django's) with a next parameter going back to the AuthorizeView.

6. After a successful login, user returns to the AuthorizeView. The
   Token is retrieved from the database using the request token. If
   it's found and not timed out yet, the User is tied to the token,
   and a redirect back to the portal follows. The redirect URL is
   found by combining the portal's redirect_url with /sso/local_login/
   and a signed message with both the request and the auth token are
   passed along.

7. User arrives at /sso/local_login, which is lizard_auth_client.views.LocalLoginView.
   This calls verify_auth_token(), which sends a request to the SSO server asking it
   what it knows about this auth token (/sso/api/verify/);

8. On the SSO server, views_sso.VerifyView checks the auth_token and if it is good,
   a JSON representation of the user is returned, of the form { 'user': user_json }.

9. LocalLoginView uses this to construct a user, save him to the
   database and log him.


For our purposes (adding roles and organizations to this code), it is
sufficient and save to add data about organizations and roles in the
JSON returned in step 8, and to process it if available in step 9.

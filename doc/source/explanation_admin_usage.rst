Explanation of /admin usage
===========================

**Important**: in the admin, the unused models have names in parenthesis. So
``(organisations)`` and ``(tokens)`` are unused ones, ``Profiles`` and ``Portals``
are in regular use.

There is no filtering in the admin: it is build for only-superuser usage for
now.

TODO: check/adjust for the new "v2 2.0" situation.

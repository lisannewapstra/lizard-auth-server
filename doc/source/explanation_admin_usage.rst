Explanation of /admin usage
===========================

**Important**: in the admin, the old models have names in parenthesis. So
``(user profiles)`` and ``(portals)`` are old ones, ``Profiles`` and ``Sites``
new ones.


TODO: document permission limitations on what you can see.


Company list page
-----------------

On the list page, the column "number of members" is a link to the user profile
list page, with the members pre-selected.


Company edit page
-----------------

At the bottom of the edit page, abovementioned link to all the members is also
present.


User profile list page
-----------------------

You can filter per company with the list on the right hand side.

You can directly edit the company, handy for mass-editing. Don't forget to
click on the "save" button at the bottom of the page!

Per user, there's a handy link to the company in case you need to adjust guest
memberships.

**Search tip** for bulk editing of companies: you can search for parts of the
email address (``@tudelft.nl``) to quickly gather all/most of a company's
employees.

The action dropdown at the top has a "convert to guest membership" item. Use
that to remove the existing organisation membership and convert it to guest
membership.

Note that the "remove user profiles" action really removes the profiles, it
doens't just remove company membership.


User profile edit page
----------------------

When editing membership and guestmembership, you'll have to jump between user
profiles and companies quite a lot. So there's a quick link to the company at
the bottom of the edit page.
